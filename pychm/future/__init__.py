"""
This is the branch of pychm containing new features and
functionality. The code contained in this module is not guaranteed
to be compatible with the other pychm libraries. After the summer
2012 release of charmming, the future module will become the new
stanard lib module, and the old codebase will be integrated, updated,
or depricated.

Please note that mod:`pychm` and mod:`pychm.future` modules are
different, and require separate import statements.
