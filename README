Description
-----------

The CHARMMing Python Library is a package used by CHARMMing to handle the
bookkeeping tasts often required in complex molecular simulations.  It is meant
to automate repetitive tasks, and make the potentially painful world of CHARMM
less so.  The CPyL is _not_ meant in any way to replicate the functionality of
other programs such a openbabel or MTSB.  This is a package written by
CHARMMing developers for CHARMMing developers.

More information can be found at http://www.charmming.org


Dependencies
------------

  * Python (2.6 <= ver < 3.0) - With some (minor) modifications to the source,
      it is possible to use ver >=2.4.
  * Numpy (tested on ver 1.2.1, use earlier versions at your own peril)


Installation Directions
-----------------------

To install as a local site package, from the shell, execute the following:
  % ./setup.py build
  % ./setup.py install --user

To install machine wide (requires root), execute the following:
  % ./setup.py build
